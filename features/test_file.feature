Feature: Integration functional testing of Redmine user rights
  As a Redmine user
  I want to be able to create projects, create issues, assign developers to issues, submit time and close issues and projects
  So I can be sure that development life cycle is correctly represented in Redmine

  Scenario: Project Admin creates a project assigns a developer to it. Developer completes task and closes it.
    Given I am not logged in visitor

     When I register 'admin' user via Redmine 'UI'
     Then I see the 'admin' user is registered
      And I become logged in as 'admin' user

     When I create a project
     Then I see that project is created on 'UI' level
      And I see that project is created on 'API' level

     When I register 'developer' user via Redmine 'API'
     Then I see the 'developer' user is registered

     When I add 'developer' user as a member of the project
     Then I can can see 'developer' user in the project member list

     When I create an issue and assign 'developer' user to created issue
     Then I see the issue is created
      And I see 'developer' user is assigned to the issue

     When I logout
     Then I am not logged in visitor

     When I login as 'developer' user
     Then I become logged in as 'developer' user

     When I track time for the assigned issue
     Then I see the time is tracked properly

     When I close the issue
     Then I see the issue was closed

     When I logout
     Then I am not logged in visitor

     When I login as 'admin' user
     Then I become logged in as 'admin' user

     When I close the project
     Then I see it was successfully closed
